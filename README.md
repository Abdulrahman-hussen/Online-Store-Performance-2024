# 📦 Data Analysis Project Online Store Performance  📊


## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an online store to optimize shipping operations, reduce delivery times, and enhance customer satisfaction. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into shipping statuses, delivery times, and the performance of major shipping carriers: DHL, FedEx, and UPS.

The dashboard also integrates sales analysis, customer behavior, and product reviews to offer a comprehensive view of the online store’s performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Track Shipping Performance: Monitor the status of shipments (Delivered, Shipped, Pending, Canceled) and identify bottlenecks in the logistics process.
- Analyze Delivery Times: Evaluate average delivery times across months to identify trends and inefficiencies.
- Compare Shipping Carriers: Assess the performance of DHL, FedEx, and UPS based on delivery speed and reliability.
- Understand Customer Behavior: Analyze purchasing patterns, satisfaction rates, and geographic distribution of customers.
- Evaluate Product Performance: Identify best-selling products and analyze customer feedback to improve product offerings.

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Excel/CSV: For data collection and preprocessing.
- Data Sources: Simulated logistics data, sales records, customer reviews, and geographic data.
